There are two databases in this project. One looking for dev data and another one for simpler test data.

To run the databases locally you will need to create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add  corresponding databes names PGDATABASE=nc_games_test and PGDATABASE=nc_games. Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
